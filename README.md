# Emoji Match

This is my submission for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Memory Game Challenge.

## How to play:

Start the game by left clicking a card on the table.  It will turn over to reveal
it's face.  Then, click another card.  If the two cards match, your match score
will increase by one!

Try to match all of the cards with the fewest clicks for the highest star rating!

Once you complete the board, a modal popup will show your final score, and give
you the option to play again.

If you do not like the hand you have been dealt, or you just want to try over
again then you may click the reset button.  The board will reset and the cards
will be shuffled!
